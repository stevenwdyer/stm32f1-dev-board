# stm32f1-dev-board

This board is an STM32F103-based development platform, designed for prototyping and developing embedded applications. The design includes:

* An STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, which features an ARM Cortex-M3 core and 128kB of flash.

* Support for multiple communication protocols, including CANbus, LINbus, I<sup>2</sup>C, SPI, USB, and UART.

* Dual clock sources, featuring a 32.768kHz crystal for precise RTC functionality, as well as an 8MHz system clock.

* An SWD interface, enabling firmware flashing and in-circuit debugging using an external ST-LINK.

* A 5V to 3.3V linear regulator, providing power for the MCU and all onboard circuitry from the USB input.

* User interface, via a reset button and a power indicator LED.

* A standardized form factor, with a 19x52mm footprint and 2.54mm pitch headers, enabling compatibility with standard breadboards for rapid prototyping.
